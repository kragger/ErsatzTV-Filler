# ErsatzTV-Filler Configuration

This Guide explains all the configuration options available via the Ersatztv-Filler configuration page. The Guide also explains how to link each option with ErsatzTV, however, the output is a video file so it is possible to use them with a program similar to ErsatzTV such as Disquetv or the video can be used for any other uses such as on a webpage or in a video player (minimal support may be provided if not used with ErsatzTV)

## The Configuration Options are:

- [General Configuration](general.md)

- [Weather Configuration](weather.md)

- [News Configuration](news.md)

- [Channel Offline Configuration](channel-offline.md)

- [XMLTV Merge Configuration](xmltv-merge.md)

- [Vanity Cards Configuration](vanity-cards.md)
