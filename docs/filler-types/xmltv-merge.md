# ErsatzTV-Filler Types and Setup (XMLTV Merge)

## What is it?

XMLTV Merge is a great way to merge 2 or more xmltv files together. It is useful if you have multiple xmltv providers and use something such as plex that only allows use of 1 xmltv file.

## How does it work?

The XMLTV Merger uses the xmltv files that the user provides and merges them together to create 1 xmltv file that can be used in places that only allow 1 xmltv file or when you want to make importing easier when you dont have to import multiple files.

## How do I set it up?

1. You will need to add your xmltv files in the configuration page.

2. Once the merger has run there is a button containing a link on the xmltvmerger configuration page, this link can be imported into your xmltv client and will provide the merged xmltv files.
