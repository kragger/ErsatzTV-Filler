# ErsatzTV-Filler Filler Types (WEATHER)

There are 4 types of weather videos,
1. Current and 3 day basic weather forecast
2. Data rich weather information
3. Weather map with city temperatures
4. All of the above joined together

To generate weather you can set your city and state in the config area, if you do not set your city and state it will automatically try and determine based off your reported online location.
Once the videos are created they are added to the other videos library in ErsatzTV, these can then be used in collections or filler and added to schedules to allow them to display on your channels.
