# ErsatzTV-Filler Filler Types and Setup (WEATHER)

## What is it?

Weather filler is a selection of videos that display the weather information for your configured location.

There are 4 types of weather videos,
1. Current and 3 day basic weather forecast
2. Data rich weather information
3. Weather map with city temperatures
4. All of the above joined together

## How does it work?

The Weather filler uses free images obtained from wttr.in to get the weather information for your location, these images are then overlayed on seperate videos that make up the weather filler.

## How do I set it up?

1. You will need to add your location in the configuration page.

2. Once the video has generated it will need to be added to ersatztv as a other video type in ersatztv. It will then need to be added to your collection which will then be scheduled and played by ersatztv.
