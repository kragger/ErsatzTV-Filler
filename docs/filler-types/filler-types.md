This is a brief explanation of what each filler type is. The Guide also explains how to link each option with ErsatzTV, however, the output is a video file so it is possible to use them with a program similar to ErsatzTV such as Disquetv or the video can be used for any other uses such as on a webpage or in a video player (minimal support may be provided if not used with ErsatzTV)
