## What is it?

Vanity Cards filler is a fun way to get a bit of variety in your channels by showing 1 of Chuck Lorres signature vanity cards in a filler video.

## How does it work?

The Vanity Cards filler uses images grabbed from the chuck lorre vanity cards website when requested and overlays them on a video that can be played on your channels.

## How do I set it up?

1. Once the video has generated it will need to be added to ersatztv as a other video type in ersatztv. It will then need to be added to your collection which will then be scheduled and played by ersatztv.
