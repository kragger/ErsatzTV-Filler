![News](../images/filler-types/news.png)

## What is it?

News filler is a great way to see the daily news headlines from your favourite rss feed inside a video with scrolling text.

## How does it work?

The News filler takes the information from the provided rss feed(s) and extracts the amount of headlines as set in the configuration. It then merges these headlines into text and overlays them scrolling on a video.

## How do I set it up?

1. Once you supply your desired newsfeed (or use the default) the news will then be added to the filler video.

2. Once the video has generated it will need to be added to ersatztv as a other video type in ersatztv. It will then need to be added to your collection which will then be scheduled and played by ersatztv.
